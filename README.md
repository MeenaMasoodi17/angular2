# Angular2 Practice Project


## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm 
    
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.


## Clone

Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., `my-proj`).
```shell
git clone https://github.com/MeenaMasoodi17/angular2.git  angular-project
cd angular-project
```
## Install npm packages

> See npm and nvm version notes above

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command first compiles application, 
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
